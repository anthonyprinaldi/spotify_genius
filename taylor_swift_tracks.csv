Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now? Why would you wanna make the very first scar? Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? It's not unbroken anymore How do I get it back the way it was before? Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
