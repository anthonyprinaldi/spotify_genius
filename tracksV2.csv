How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing. So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways. So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared. I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said ""I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else"". So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called ""I Know Places"". So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song ""Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing: Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i Na na na na waiting at the back door They're around and the vultures come around And you know that they won't, they won't us Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us And you come and sing and listen I would not think about it but I'm not done Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes And guns They are the hunters we are the foxes And we run Baby, I know some places we won't be found And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down Cause I, I know places we can hide I know places, I know places Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places Or whatever. I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and it's about, like, everybody's, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus. So I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing. It would be, like, . Like, very, like, beat. Now I'm just making weird sounds. Hope you like it!"

This is  a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ""I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds."" And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ""Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me"". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called ""I Wish You Would"", because Jack wrote back and said ""I love that"". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track: Okay so this is an idea called ""I Wish You Would"". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this It's 2 am, in your car Windows down, past my street the memories start It's in the past You drive straight ahead You thinking that I hate you now 'Cause you still don't know what I never said I wish you would come back Wish I never hung up the phone like I did I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good I wish you would Do you like it!?"

Um, so I brought in this idea called ""Blank Space,"" and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the ""Oh!"" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called ""Blank Space."" ""Nice to meet you, where you been?
